# Browser-Proxy

A proof-of-concept Chrome extension that acts as a website proxy by capturing page content and storing it server side. The extension communicates with a FastAPI backend that saves files to S3.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a detailed overview of the planned architecture. The [docs/diagrams.md](docs/diagrams.md) file contains visual diagrams of the system.
